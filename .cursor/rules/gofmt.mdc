# Implementation Standards for Go (`gofmt`)

- All Go source files (`*.go`) **must** be formatted using the standard `gofmt` tool before commit or merge.
- Code **should not** be manually aligned or formatted in a way that conflicts with `gofmt` output.
- Formatting is enforced on all files matching the glob: `**/*.go`.
- If a file is not properly formatted, the change **may be rejected** or require reformatting.
- Use the command `gofmt -w .` in the project root to automatically format all Go files.
- Consistent formatting improves readability, reduces diffs, and follows the Go community's best practices.
